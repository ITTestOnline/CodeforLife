#Codeforlife is a 48-hour online hackathon.

The #colectivfire and #ParisAttack tragedies were the triggers that made us think of a solution for us to work together and put our problem-solving skills to use. The purpose of #Codeforlife is to implement algorithms for better planning, simulation and coordination of emergency evacuations in public venues.

All of the challenges can be solved in 4 programming languages: C++, Java, C# .NET and PHP.

The best algorithms from the #codeforlife hackathon will be published on GitHub and shared with the authorities in each participating country, at the same time encouraging teams and individuals in the respective countries to follow-up and build software which can make a difference in such a situation.

It's up to us to use our skills and support life by all means!

INFORMATION
Tips & tricks before you start coding:

1. Once you enter the exercise, it will be available until the 10th of April at 16h00 CET. Please be aware that the exercise can be solved only in the initial browser where you have opened it.

2. You can solve it directly on the platform or copy/paste the code in your own IDE, and just compile it on the platform. Please keep in mind the compiler version for each language defined on the platform.

3. Please press the Finish Button only when your solution is complete.

We want to thank all our ‪#‎codeforlife‬ contributors for a weekend brilliantly spent!

We are now one step closer to optimize emergency evacuations in public venues.
